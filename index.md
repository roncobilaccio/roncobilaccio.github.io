# About me
I was born in 1993 and I currently live in Florence.
I love cinema, TV series, sports (especially tennis), hiking, D&D, and videogames.
I enjoy adventures and having fun with people who share the same passions.

## What I do
I work in the world of software and technology, where I design and develop applications with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and long‑term reliability.
I enjoy solving problems, improving processes, and creating tools that make everyday work smoother.
I specialize in .NET, C#, SQL Server, and backend development.
